SEN 201 Assignment: Attendance Management System using SDLC

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC) FOR ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
1. Requirements Analysis

The requirements analysis phase identifies the needs of the users and the objectives of the system.

Functional Requirements

a. The system shall allow the user to mark student attendance.
b. The system shall store attendance records.
c. The system shall display attendance records.
d. The system shall allow the user to exit the system.

Non-Functional Requirements

a. The system shall be easy to use.
b. The system shall be reliable.
c. The system shall respond efficiently to user input.

2. System Design

The system design phase defines the structure and components of the Attendance Management System.

a. The system is divided into three major modules: Mark Attendance Module, View Attendance Module, and Exit Module.
b. The Mark Attendance Module is responsible for recording student attendance.
c. The View Attendance Module is responsible for displaying stored attendance records.
d. The Exit Module is responsible for terminating the system.
e. Attendance records are stored using a list data structure named attendance_records.
f. Each attendance record consists of a student name and attendance status.

3. Implementation

The implementation phase involves translating the system design into a working program.

a. The Attendance Management System is implemented using the Python programming language.
b. Each module identified in the design phase is implemented as a Python function.
c. The functions used include mark_attendance, view_attendance, and exit_system.
d. User interaction is achieved through input and output statements.

4. Testing

The testing phase ensures that the system works according to the specified requirements.

a. The system was tested by marking attendance for multiple students.
b. The system was tested to confirm that attendance records are correctly stored.
c. The system was tested to verify that attendance records are displayed accurately.
d. The system was tested to ensure proper handling of invalid user input.
e. The system was tested to confirm correct system termination.

5. Deployment

The deployment phase involves making the system available for use.

a. The Attendance Management System is deployed by running the Python program on a local computer.
b. The source code is hosted on GitHub for accessibility and version control.

6. Maintenance

The maintenance phase involves updating and improving the system after deployment.

a. Future improvements may include storing attendance records in files or databases.
b. Additional features such as course and date tracking may be added.
c. A graphical user interface may be implemented to improve usability.
